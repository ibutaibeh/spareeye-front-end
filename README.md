## What is SpareEye?
SpareEye is an intelligent car repair assistance platform built using the MERN stack.
When your car is damaged or a part is broken, you simply take a photo, add a short description, and submit it through the app. An AI-powered agent reviews the image and description, then recommends the best course of action — whether it’s a quick fix, replacement, or professional service.
## Why SpareEye?
Quick diagnosis — No need to waste time guessing the problem or visiting multiple mechanics.

AI recommendations — Get smart, reliable suggestions based on your car’s actual condition.

Convenience — Submit issues anytime, anywhere, right from your phone or browser.

Cost-effective — Avoid unnecessary repairs by getting accurate insights first.
